This application is designed for searching users and their repositories on Github by using Search Github API. 
Using the app is very easy. 
You should install all dependencies in root project folder by running

```npm install```  

and then run the project 

```npm start```

Now you are on the main page. Cool! 
Write more than 3 letters of Github user name in the search field and wait a bit, in few seconds you will get answer. 
Enjoy :)
