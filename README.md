This application is for searching users and their repositories on Github by using Search API. 
Using the app is very easy. 
You should install all dependencies (write npm install in the terminal in root project folder) and run the project (npm start at the same place).
Now you are on the main page. Cool! 
Write more than 3 letters of Github user name in the search field and wait a bit, in few seconds you will get answer. 
Enjoy :)
